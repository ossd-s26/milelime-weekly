## Just How Fun is Open Source?

Imagine a large group of leftists, libertarians, programming savants, tech
executives, and software philosophers. Now imagine that you have created a
project that absolutely all of them use on a daily basis. An unregulated
discussion forum full of these people would quickly devolve into the worst
cesspit of toxic rhetoric on the internet.

That's not very fun.

Luckily these people all have one thing in common: they care about your
software and either want to use or contribute to it.

After listening to [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYwTDNA3Uac) and
reading several codes of conduct/community guidelines
([Go](https://golang.org/conduct),
[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php),
[Sugar Labs](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct),
[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/community+guidelines)), it's
easier to see that we can make an open source environment that is focused on
contribution to the shared source code.

That does sound fun!

## Contributor Covenant

The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/)
is a simply written (and beautifully named) code of conduct template for free
and open source projects. It is general enough that the discretion for
enforcement is left in core project maintainers' hands. It also details some
examples of acceptable and unacceptable behavior.

Both Go and Eclipse, two open source projects, enforce codes of conduct based
on the Contributor Covenant. The Go code of conduct adds to the source material
by explicitly outlining desired contributor values and their conflict
resolution methods. The Eclipse code of conduct also adds to the source
material and spends much more effort explaining their enforcement mechanism.
It also includes a clause stating that "The Eclipse Foundation Board of
Directors may amend this Code from time to time and may vary the procedures it
sets out where appropriate in a particular case," allowing for more
discretionary response to complaints.

## Other Codes of Conduct

Sugar Labs is another open source project. Their code of conduct is based on
the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/ethos/code-of-conduct).
The two are very similar, but most of the latter half of the original document
has been left out.

Finally, I examined the iNaturalist community guidelines. These are not exactly
contribution rules as all of the other codes of conduct have been framed, but
the [contribution readme](https://github.com/inaturalist/inaturalist/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
links to this set of community guidelines at the bottom. This set of rules does
not appear to be based on any existing document and is very specific to the
usage of the platform as is. This may be because of the nature of a project
like iNaturalist. Most people use the hosted site itself and make contributions
as users (like Wikipedia) rather than contributing code or using the software
themselves.

## Other News

This was an excellent exercise. Learning more the problems that free and open
source projects core maintainers have to solve has grown my appreciation for
them and helps mne understand why huge foundations like those around Mozilla
and Linux exists to help support their respective projects and others.
