title: "Week 1: Why Open Source?"

## What does open source software mean to me?

I have an ideological commitment and belief in the strong regulation and
breakup of technological monopolies. The framework of open source and free
software is the cornerstone of the maintenance of freedom in a
"technofeudalist" (or less controversially surveilance-first) world and
predatory vendor lock-in and advertising.

The biggest problem with user-facing open source software is often the
difficulty of use. This is not the users' fault: users are made to be ignorant
of how their machines and possessions work. They are robbed of ownership
by companies like Adobe and others in exchange for products that "just work."

This rhetoric and business model ensures a lack of "power users." Many open
source tools that act as alternatives to corporate solutions are terminal based,
complicated to install, have lacking documentation, or are simply worse than
paid or closed source alternatives.

Free software is the future but an ideological shift must occur that pushes
users to take interest in their possessions and to believe they have the means
to make changes they wish to see themselves.

## What projects do I regularly use?

cloudflare-ddns is simply a tool that helps keep my CloudFlare DNS settings
up to date. I cannot purchase a static IP from my ISP without opening a
business account, so I use this tool instead of a third-party dynamic DNS
service.
