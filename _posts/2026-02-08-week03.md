title: "Week 3: Developing an Open Source Browser Extension"
---

## Our Extension

My team is composed of three other lovely and personable characters. We
decided to create a simple Chrome-browser-based extension to convert
temperatures from Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Our inital goals were to
decide on the license we should use and find existing extensions with open
source licenses that we could examine for inspiration.

While we have not yet decided on the license, we are leaning towards the FSF's
recommendation of the GPL because of its copyleft restrictions.

We found [this extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/everything-metric-auto-un/hknjpaididhfgeocegbacehlnkofjoni),
but its repo on Github did not contain a license. I sought out the creator
across several platforms and was able to get in touch with him on Instagram.
He gave us explicit permission to do whatever we wanted to with his project's
source code and told me that the original project he had based it on used the
MIT license. This of course doesn't give us any use of his distribution, but
his explicit documented permission does.
